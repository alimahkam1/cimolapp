# üìä CimolBot ‚Äì DSC Talent Request Portal

**CimolBot** is an interactive AI-powered web application designed to assist teams within Telkom DBT in identifying and requesting the right data talents (Data Analyst, Data Scientist, etc.) from the DSC (Data Science & AI Chapter). Built with Streamlit and OpenAI API integration, it streamlines the process of talent recommendation and request documentation.

---

## üéØ Purpose & Goal

The primary **goal** of CimolBot is to:

* **Simplify** the process of requesting data talents for internal projects.
* **Provide AI-powered recommendations** for suitable roles based on user-submitted project descriptions.
* **Enable automation** of request handling via SharePoint, Power Automate, and WhatsApp notifications.

---

## üß† How It Works

### 1. **User Input & Onboarding**

* Users must fill in their **name**, **unit**, and **email** and agree to a **privacy policy** via the sidebar.
* Once onboarded, users can choose between:

  * **Chatbot Mode**
  * **Recommendation Mode**

---

### 2. üßæ Chatbot Mode

* Designed for **general Q\&A** regarding **data roles** (Data Analyst, Engineer, Scientist, etc.).
* Contextual responses are generated using **OpenAI's LLM**, based on a provided PDF knowledge document (`Data Roles Indonesian.pdf`).
* Helps educate users before requesting a talent.

---

### 3. ü§ñ Recommendation Mode

* Users describe their project and the kind of data support they need.
* The system generates:

  * A **recommended role**
  * Suggested **talent level** (Junior/Middle/Senior)
  * **Talent count**
  * Key **responsibilities and bullet-point descriptions**
* Based on available talent data from a backend API (`flow_url`), the app suggests matching personnel.

---

### 4. üì© Request Finalization

* Once a user accepts a recommendation:

  * A **payload is sent to Power Automate** (via webhook)
  * A **WhatsApp notification** is sent to the DSC management using **Twilio API**
  * A **Word document (NDE draft)** is automatically generated using `docxtpl` and uploaded to **SharePoint**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** Streamlit
* **LLM Integration:** OpenAI (via custom API & headers)
* **Document Automation:** `docxtpl`
* **Backend Communication:** HTTP POST requests (to internal APIs / Power Automate)
* **Notifications:** Twilio WhatsApp API
* **File I/O & Uploads:** SharePoint (via encoded payload)

---

## üîê Security & Privacy

* The app requires users to **explicitly consent** to the privacy policy before accessing its features.
* All API keys and endpoints are managed securely via `st.secrets`.
